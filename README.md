# titanic_survival_prediction
Using Python the Titanic train dataset is cleaned, structured and then a model is built and trained using various supervised learning algorithms. The same model is used to predict the survival rate of the test dataset.

Datasets used: train.csv, test.csv
Algortihms tested:
1. KNN
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest
4. Naive Bayes
5. Perceptron
6. Stochastic Gradient Decent
7. Decision Tree
